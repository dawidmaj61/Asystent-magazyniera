# Warehouse_assistant
WarehouseAssistant is a mobile application developed as part of an engineering project. The aim of the engineering project was to create a system for supporting the location of pallet nests using a mobile application. 
Finished application has the task to minimize duration of the ride from the point of adopted to the destinations. 

## Features
The task of the mobile application is to provide information about the free space for a pallet in the storage department in the easiest and fastest way.
